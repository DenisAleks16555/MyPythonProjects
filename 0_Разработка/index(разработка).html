    <span><h2>What is HTML?</h2></span>
    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language<u>(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Web browsers receive<b><u>HTML</u></b> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <b><u>HTML</u></b> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        <br/>
    
        
        <p><b><u>HTML</u></b> elements are the building blocks of <b>HTML</b>  pages. With <b>HTML</b> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <b>HTML</b> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <b>HTML</b> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <abbr>img</abbr>  and <pre>input</pre>  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the<b>HTML</b> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page</p>

                <h2><span>Markup</span></h2>
                <br/>
                <p><span>HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <pre><h1></pre> and <pre></h1></pre>,although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Another important component is the</p> <span>HTML</span>document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

                The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
                <br/>
                         <code>                         
                        
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                    <html>
                        <head>
                        <title>This is a title</title>
                            </head>
                            <body>
                                <p>Hello world!</p>
                            </body>
                    </html>
                    
                </code>
